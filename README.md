## Workout Buddy

Workout Buddy is an app designed to help users hold themselves accountable to hitting fitness goals. Workout Buddy enables users to keep a personal workout log to plan and track workout activity, selecting from a variety of pre-built workouts as well as creating custom workouts of their own. Users can visualize their progress against their weekly goals in their personal Workout Buddy dashboard.
